        <p class="lead">
        Controlled burning is one of Australia's most important land management tools. It reduces fuel loads,
        protects habitats, and prevents larger fires. However, over the years 2016-2021, the balance between
        planned and unplanned fires changed dramatically. This story visualises that shift across
        multiple dimensions: spatial, temporal, and intensity, with an increased focus on the build-up to the 
        Black Summer period of September 2019 to January 2020, using accurate data reports and figures.

            <p>As can be ascertained from the visualization, states like Queensland and Northern Territory
              have also been prone to hosting unplanned bushfires, at a number much more than other Australian
              states. As expected, around the period 2019-20, both Queensland and Northern Territory experienced
              an increase in unplanned bushfires, along with New South Wales and Victoria reaching numbers they had 
              never reached before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regions of Australia with arid interiors have always burned more in the summertime, yet, the recordings
              during and leading up to the Black Summer revealed how rising temperatures and dry fuel loads brought bushfire
              risk closer to the populated communities of Australia.

          <div class="text-block">
            <p>Australia's strategy once revolved around planned bushfires - delibrate, low-intensity fires to 
              manage fuel loads and prevent catastrophic burnings. As conditions worsened however, unplanned 
              bushfires began to dominate. Observing from 2018 to 2019, we see a change in the number of unplanned
              bushfires / total bushfires from 48% to 54%. This then increases to 58% in 2020, clearly visualizing
              the increase.
            </p>
            <p>
              This shift in the share of unplanned bushfires in total bushfires signals how climate change managed to
              outpace traditional control methods, decreasing the effective of prevention when it was most needed.

        <div class="text-block" style="max-width: 70ch; margin: .8rem auto 0;">
          <p>In the Northern states, unplanned bushfire numbers have occupied most of Australia's
             unplanned bushfires. As the trend can be observed from the beginning of 2019, both Northern
             states recorded an increase in unplanned bushfires and therefore, a decreased in planned ones.
             A surprise was the rapid increase of unplanned bushfires in the South-East of Australia, notably
             New South Wales and Victoria, peaking in the window of late 2019 and early 2020.     
          </p>
          <p>
            After the summer period in early 2020, the Australian government's response to the Black Summer 
            resulted in a decrease in unplanned bushfires across all states with an increase in planned ones, 
            further limiting the possibility of enduring another Black Summer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The synchrony across multiple states signified how multiple factors (heat, drought, wind) all came into 
            play in a way that overwhelmed Australia's fire management resources and bushfire preparations. Since then, 
            Australia hasn't faced such a catastrophic event, mostly owing to their increased importance on bushfire
            preparations.

            <p>The chart accurately represents the number of occurences of bushfires captured by the VIIRS satellite
               as well as the reliability of the occurrence. Each point is spread over a 20 km radius which encapsulates
               all occurrences. The data is modelled from Sep 2019 - Jan 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In the months of September, October and November, the majority of hotspots are observed in the Northern states,
              with activity increasing in the South-East as the months progress. It's most notable in December that bushfires 
              progress to an unprecedent rate, especially in the South-East states, a densely populated region that hasn't 
              experienced bushfires of this magnitude before. The data from January 2020 supports our conclusion that the 
              Australian government, aided by changing natural parameters, was able to put a stop to the catastrophic burnings
              and subdue the Black Summer.

          <p>The stream chart supports the findings and conclusions of the previous visualizations by modelling
            the increase in firebush detections from September 2019, with the peak being reached in November 2019.

            The chart clearly displays the catastrophe that ocurred over the 5 months between September 2019 and 
            January 2020. Scattered events turned into a nation-wide emergency, with the country facing unprecendented
            odds. These visualizations serve to enforce the effects of the Black Summer and in general, catastrophic bushfires.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Between 2016 to 2021, Australia's approach to bushfire management received its greatest test.
          Planned burns either remained steady or decreased, while unplanned fires surged, culminating in 
          the Black Summer. These visualizations not only showcase when and where fires burned, but how the 
          balance between prevention and catastrophe shifted, leaving an indellible mark on the Australian landscape.
